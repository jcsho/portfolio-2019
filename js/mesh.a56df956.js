For example, current digital design tools only support designing in a linear manner, lacking the ability to manipulate or reuse parts of a design without much effort from the user. At the beginning, I created a pitch in the domain I was familiar with, web development, and convinced two others to join me for the rest of the project. As a user of prototyping tools, I understood the limitations that often come with them. For example, it is often easier to sketch out designs using pen and paper before creating a digital prototype despite the software offering more accurate drawing tools. The issue comes when comparing, contrasting, or modifying the many sketches being generated; software based tools do not assist my needs as a designer to create changes without destructive properties or using software like paper (copying and pasting for every change).

During this time, I focused on defining differentiations between the linked designs. Although the method is crude, I decided that in the web development domain, layout and styling are the most important quantifiable parameters the system can use to determine differences between designs.
